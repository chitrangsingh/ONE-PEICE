              <h2>What Is Depression</h2>
              <p>The ICD-10 is used around the world to diagnose people with illnesses like depression. According to the ICD-10, for a person to be diagnosed with depression, their symptoms have to last for at least two weeks. The symptoms must happen every day, or almost every day. These symptoms also have to cause problems in a person's life (like their work life, family life, social life, or other important parts of their life).</p>

                <h3>Understanding Depression: Causes and Symptoms</h3>
                <p>As of 2016, scientists believe there is no one cause of depression. There is a lot of argument over whether depression is caused by biological, cognitive, or sociocultural factors:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Biological explanations of depression focus on changes in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters).</li>
                  <li>Cognitive explanations of depression focus on how the way we think (cognition) affects our mood. These explanations say that if a person thinks negatively, this thinking can make them feel negatively about themselves and the world around them.</li>
                  <li>Sociocultural explanations of depression blame stressful things like divorce, losing a job, bullying, and poverty for causing depression. The United States National Institutes of Health say that depression comes from the brain. However, scientists are still trying to find out exactly why it happens.</li>

              <h3>Tips for Managing Depression on a Daily Basis</h3>
              <p>Management of depression is the treatment of depression that may involve a number of different therapies: medications, behavior therapy, psychotherapy, and medical devices.</p>
              <p>Depression is a symptom of some physical diseases; a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments; and a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia. Physical causes are ruled out with a clinical assessment of depression that measures vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and hormones.</p>
              <p>Though psychiatric medication is the most frequently prescribed therapy for major depression, psychotherapy may be effective, either alone or in combination with medication. Combining psychotherapy and antidepressants may provide a "slight advantage," but antidepressants alone or psychotherapy alone are not significantly different from other treatments, like "active intervention controls" (e.g., sham acupuncture). Given an accurate diagnosis of major depressive disorder, in general, the type of treatment (psychotherapy and/or antidepressants, alternate or other treatments, or active intervention) is "less important than getting depressed patients involved in an active therapeutic program."</p>
              <p>Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice in those under the age of 18, with medication offered only in conjunction with the former and generally not as a first-line agent. The possibility of depression, substance misuse, or other mental health problems in the parents should be considered and, if present and if it may help the child, the parent should be treated in parallel with the child.</p>
